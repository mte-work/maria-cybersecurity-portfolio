# Users, Groups, and Permissions

## Objective
Understand how user accounts, groups, and file permissions control access on a Linux system.

## Why This Matters
Improper permissions and misconfigured accounts are common causes of security breaches.
Managing access correctly helps prevent unauthorized actions and privilege escalation.

## Summary
This section demonstrated Linux access control through user and group management, file ownership, and permissions. Commands such as `whoami`, `id`, `groups`, `ls -l`, `chmod`, `stat`, and `chgrp` illustrate how user identity and group membership determine what files a user can access and modify. Proper permission management enforces least privilege and helps prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data.

## Environment
- OS: Ubuntu 24.04 LTS (Virtual Machine)
