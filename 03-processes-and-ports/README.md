# Processes and Ports

## Objective
Learn how to identify running processes and open network ports on a Linux system.

## Why This Matters
Unauthorized processes and exposed ports are common entry points for attackers. Being able to identify and analyze them is a core cybersecurity skill.

## Summary
This section demonstrated how to identify running processes and active network ports on a Linux system. Monitoring processes (`ps aux`) and listening services (`ss -tuln`) is essential for detecting unauthorized activity, understanding system exposure, and maintaining secure operations.

## Environment
- OS: Ubuntu 24.04 LTS (Virtual Machine)
